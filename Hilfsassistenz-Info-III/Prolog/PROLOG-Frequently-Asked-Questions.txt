     This article contains the answers to some Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) often seen in comp.lang.prolog.  It is posted
(twice a month, currently on the 1st and 16th) to help reduce
volume in this newsgroup and to provide hard-to-find information
of general interest.

     The World Wide Web URL for this FAQ is:
http://www.selwerd.nl/~dirk-jan/prolog/faq/

     This article includes answers to the following questions.

 0. General information
 1. What is the Association for Logic Programming?
 2. Where can I get a public-domain, free Prolog for system
    X (the IBM PC, the Mac, Unix or other)?
 3. What commercial systems are available?  What about systems
    available for a price from research institutions?
 4. How do I get in touch with my Prolog's users' group,
    sales representative, or technical support line?
 5. I think language X is better than Prolog.  What do you think?
 6. What are the recent developments?
 7. My Prolog prof assigned me this problem.  Can you help
    me with it?
 8. Can you suggest some books on Prolog?
 9. Are there any FTP archive sites for comp.lang.prolog?
10. How can I get a copy of the draft ISO Prolog standard?
    Where can I go for more information about it?
11. How does the WAM (Warren Abstract Machine) work?  How do I
    write a WAM-based compiler or a WAM emulator?
12. Is there a WWW (World Wide Web) page on logic programming?
13. Can do I do Internet/WWW programming with Prolog?
14. Is there a WWW (World Wide Web) page with some tutorials on
    prolog?

     Please forward suggestions for further questions and
answers to the current FAQ maintainer, dirk-jan at selwerd.nl
(Dirk-Jan Faber).

Changes in this version:
* Update of GNU Prolog (version, ftp site)
* Added another Prolog tutorial to section 14 of the FAQ
* Fixed an error in the year the book of Bratko was published

0. General information

     The newsgroup "comp.lang.prolog" discusses the language
Prolog and other "logic programming" languages.  Logic
programming languages, in general, are programming languages
which incorporate some of the language of mathematical logic;
unification and backtracking search are common operational
features.  For more background information about Prolog, see the
list of books in Question 7 of this list.

     To cut down on unnecessary postings to comp.lang.prolog,
whenever I see a question there that is answered by the FAQ
list, I (Dirk-Jan) try to respond to the questioner by e-mail,
quoting the relevant section of this list.

technology, readers can join the Association for Logic
Programming (ALP) and receive their Newsletter.  For details on
how to join, contact:

     The Prolog Resource Guide (v0.6) was printed in issue 5/1
of the Newsletter (Feb. 1992). This lists information concerning
Prolog Archives, Books, Suppliers, etc.  It is now maintained by
Mark Kantrowitz (Mark.Kantrowitz at GLINDA.OZ.CS.CMU.EDU), and
used to be posted periodically (?) to comp.lang.prolog (see question 
3 and 8).

2. Where can I get a public-domain, free Prolog for system X
   (the IBM PC, the Mac, Unix or other)?

     The following are anonymous-FTP sites for free Prologs
(or related languages) which are either in the public domain or
are "copy-lefted" (permitted to be copied with some restrictions
on commercial use).

     (Please note that for extensive development work, users
will probably want a robust interpreter or compiler with good
debugging facilities and a standard syntax, among other things.
While public-domain systems are a valuable service to the
community, they do not necessarily have all these things, and
users should weigh carefully what they want to do against the
capabilities and costs of the available systems.)

3. What commercial systems are available?  What about systems
   available for a price from research institutions?

     Many commercial systems are listed in the periodically
posted Prolog Resource Guide.  The Resource Guide also lists
many systems which are not exactly "commercial", but available
for a price from research instutitions.  The list of such
systems was originally compiled by Chris Moss, of Imperial
College.  The rest of the Resource Guide was originally compiled
by Dag Wahlberg, of Uppsala University.

     The Resource Guide is now maintained by the kind efforts
of Mark Kantrowitz, "Mark.Kantrowitz at GLINDA.OZ.CS.CMU.EDU", who
posted it on the 14th of every month on comp.lang.prolog.  It is
also available by anonymous FTP from "ftp.cs.cmu.edu"
[128.2.206.173] in the directory
"/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository-3/ai/lang/prolog/faq",
as the files "prg_1.faq" and "prg_2.faq".

     Readers should also note that the Prolog Management Group
(formerly the Prolog Vendors' Group) is contactable
electronically via its Secretary, Steve Cartmell.  His address
is "steve at pap.com".

4. How do I get in touch with my Prolog's users' group,
   sales representative, or technical support line?

     Here are some e-mail addresses of these contacts, listed
alphabetically by company or major product name.  Please note
that sometimes phoning or writing to the company will get better
response than e-mail.

5. I think language X is better than Prolog.  What do you think?

     These debates rarely result in any productive discussion.
To some extent, one's favourite language is based on irrational
ideology.

     However, many people now agree that different languages are
good for different things.  Prolog seems to be good for problems
in which logic is intimately involved, or whose solutions have a
succinct logical characterization.  Like other interactive,
symbolic languages, Prolog is also good for rapid prototyping.

     Also, please note that there are many different "Prologs"
and other logic programming languages available, all with
different capabilities.

			*	*	*

6. What are the recent developments? 

     There are some languages in development which do not have
Prolog syntax, but do subsume and generalize Prolog's logic 
programming abilities.

The Mozart Consortium:
  Information:	http://www.mozart-oz.org/
  Users' group: users-request at mozart-oz.org
  Tech support: users at mozart-oz.org

Some other languages bring new developments while also supporting
Prolog syntax and functionality as an option:

7. My Prolog prof assigned me this problem.  Can you help
   me with it?

     If your instructor assigned it to you, he or she probably
wanted you to do it yourself.  If it's an introductory Prolog
course, your question might be elementary to most readers, so it
might be a waste of network resources to ask it.  Please ask
your instructor, a friend, a teaching assistant, or a local
newsgroup for help first.

     That being said, there are comp.lang.prolog readers who
would be glad to help people making a legitimate attempt to
learn Prolog.

			*	*	*

8. Can you suggest some books on Prolog?

     The Prolog Resource Guide (see above, question 3) contains
a listing of Prolog books.  It is maintained by Mark Kantrowitz
(Mark.Kantrowitz at GLINDA.OZ.CS.CMU.EDU), and posted periodically
on comp.lang.prolog.

     Here are some of the most popular books on Prolog.

9. Are there any FTP archive sites for comp.lang.prolog?

     No. That is, the following archives used to contain
the articles from comp.lang.prolog, but at latest check 
(1-2-1999) I (Dirk-Jan) have failed to log in. 
"info2.rus.uni-stuttgart.de":
  /pub/comm/news/archive/comp.archives/auto/comp.lang.prolog
"cs.dal.ca": /pub/comp.archives/comp.lang.prolog

     Some other sites contain copies of this FAQ list and the
Prolog Resource Guide (see question 3).  For users with "archie"
access, type "archie comp.lang.prolog" for an up-to-date list of
sites having either archives or the periodic postings.

Other (web) archives of comp.lang.prolog include Dejanews:
http://www.dejanews.com/home_ps.shtml
and Reference:
http://www.reference.com/

10. How can I get a copy of the draft ISO Prolog standard?
    Where can I go for more information about it?

     You can pick up a copy by anonymous FTP from site
"ai.uga.edu", directory "/pub/prolog.standard".  The directory
also contains a summary of the standard, by Michael Covington,
in the "isoprolog" files.  Note that no one at that site can
answer any questions about the standard; it is just an FTP site
for the standard in the USA.

     A copy of Richard O'Keefe's Prolog standard draft from 1984
is available from "ftp.ecrc.de", file /pub/eclipse/pub/std/plstd.doc".

11. How does the WAM (Warren Abstract Machine) work?  How do I
    write a WAM-based compiler or a WAM emulator?

     Reportedly the best tutorial is Hassan Ait-Kaci's book
_Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial Reconstruction_ (MIT
Press, 1991).  A public-domain WAM emulator, written in C++ by
Herve Touati, is available by anonymous FTP at site
"gatekeeper.dec.com", in directory "pub/plan/prolog/ucb".
The book is now OP but available online at
http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~hak/documents/wam.html

12. Is there a WWW (World Wide Web) page on logic programming?

     Yes, there is one by Jonathan Bowen; the URL is
"http://archive.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/logic-prog.html".
He invites us to mail him at "jonathan.bowen at sbu.ac.uk" with any
relevant information for inclusion.

13. Can do I do Internet/WWW programming with Prolog?

     Prolog is very suitable for this task. Several commercial 
and free implementations include special support for it. A page 
specifically on this topic (including some tutorials) is maintained 
at http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/lpnet/lpnet.html
A public-domain library exists (PiLLoW) for several popular Prolog
systems which helps in the task. See:

             <LI>Enter a list of the names of men seeking partners.
             <LI>Enter a list of the names of women seeking partners. The
                 names are separated by blancs and the list of names is 
                 terminated by newline. There should be the same number of 
                 men as women in the partnering process.
             <LI>For each person, enter the city that person lives in.
             <LI>For each person, enter a list of at most 5 interests e.g. music, films, cooking.
                 The interests are separated by blancs and the list of
                 interests is terminated by newline.
             <LI>Each man should indicate for each woman how attractive they find
                 that woman by giving a number in the range 1-10. (10 = most attractive)
             <LI>Each woman should indicate for each man how attractive they find
                 that man by giving a number in the range 1-10. (10 = most attractive)

      <DD>Based on the preference lists generated in step 2, find a
          best match of partners such that there are no pairs of men and 
          women who would prefer to be with each other rather than with 
          their partners.
